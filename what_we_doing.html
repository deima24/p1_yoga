      New to Yoga? Things to Know Before Taking Your First Class
    </h1>

    <section>
      <p class="new-to-yoga">
        If you're preparing to attend a yoga class for the first time, it would
        be perfectly natural to feel some low-level anxiety. You might be
        worrying: What's it like to execute a Downward Dog pose? How well will I
        be able to follow the teacher's instructions? Can I fit in with
        experienced yogis? Knowing what to expect can help you maximize what you
        get out of the class.
      </p>

      <h2 class="things-to-know">
        Here are 10 things you should expect in are class:
      </h2>

      <ul class="list-to-know">
        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>You'll learn new breathing exercises.</span>
            Everyone breathes to stay alive, but in yoga you`ll be learning
            breathing practices to do with poses and movement. The breath is
            thought to be associated with the energy of the body, and we know
            from science that changes in your breath can change your heart rate
            and nervous system.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>Be prepared to move and do a series of poses.</span>
            The poses you'll do might be seated, standing or lying down.
            Regardless of what the instructor suggests, you shouldn't do
            anything that hurts you or feels uncomfortable. Every pose has
            countless variations, and no one knows your body better than you.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span> The yoga instructor will ask you to pay attention. </span>
            Store your cellphone in your gym bag or leave it in your locker when
            you're in yoga class and pay attention to the instructor. Yoga is a
            mindfulness practice, in which you need to be present in the
            moment.Part of the practice is to notice what`s happening in your
            body, what's happening with your senses, what's happening in the
            world around you.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>You'll probably feel lost.</span>
            As with many endeavors you're trying for the first time, you
            probably won`t know how to do many or even any of the poses the
            instructor leads you through.You're not expected to know anything at
            your first class, and that's perfectly fine. That's why the
            instructor is there. Don't feel bad if you spend a good part of your
            first class looking at other students to see what pose you're
            supposed to be doing, it's part of the learning process.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>You're likely to feel slightly uncomfortable.</span>
            When we move our bodies in new ways, it always feels a little
            awkward or uncomfortable. Don't be alarmed if you feel some
            awkwardness or discomfort that's normal, and every first-time yogi
            goes through that stage. Just observe and relish being in the
            beginner's mindset. This allows you to feel and notice things you
            don`t usually perceive. There's the inherent discomfort of being in
            a new space with new people doing something new that may encourage a
            feeling of vulnerability.
          </p>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>Props will probably be available.</span>
            Props can be particularly useful for people with certain chronic
            conditions, like arthritis, which can make you stiff, or
            fibromyalgia, which is associated with joint pain. But props can be
            useful for many people, whether they have a chronic condition or
            not. For example, if a yoga pose involves reaching forward to grab
            your feet while sitting, but you don`t have the flexibility to do
            that, you can use a strap to lengthen your reach.

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>The instructor may offer adjustments.</span>
            Instructor will offer adjustments while you're engaged in a pose.
            That means putting their hands on you to guide you. An instructor
            will typically say that if you don't want to be guided to let him or
            her know, sometimes by raising a hand. It's really important for
            students to know they have agency over their own body, and can
            decline if they don`t want adjustments.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span
              >Your instructor might lead you in a chant or meditation.
            </span>
            At different points in the class, your instructor may lead you in a
            chant or quiet meditation. This can seem strange if you're not used
            to it. The chanting is to unify the group, create some sound
            resonance in the body and shift energy. The meditation calms the
            mind and improves mental health and cognition. You can choose to try
            it out or just be in the room and notice how it sounds or feels.
          </p>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span> The class will probably end with deep relaxation. </span>
            At the end of many classes, the instructor will ask participants to
            lay down and, perhaps, to close their eyes. Some teachers will dim
            the lights and talk the class through a few minutes of guided
            relaxation, while others will let yogis rest in silence.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="things-in-class">
          <p>
            <span>Expect to feel sore the next day.</span>
            Practicing yoga is associated with alleviating pain, improved
            flexibility and toning your muscles. But initially, you may feel
            soreness. Any time we move in new ways, we use some muscles more
            intensely than they are used to. If you wake up the morning after
            your first yoga class with sore thighs or back muscles, that's no
            cause for alarm.
