                The literal translation of the word “yoga,” which is from Sanskrit (recognized as the original language of yoga) is
                “union,” says Sherwin.right up arrow And that's an apt way to describe yoga as we know it today, she says. “We define it
                as bringing together the mind and the body by use of the breath.”
                Many people have come to know the physical benefits of yoga and think of it as a type of workout, says Sherwin. But yoga
                is way more than that. “It's really an entire lifestyle; the postures are only one piece of it,” she says.
                
                Yoga began in India and has been around for about 5,000 years, says Sherwin. “Originally it was taught one-on-one and
                only to men of the highest caste,” she says.
