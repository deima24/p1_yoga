                <p>
                    Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual system for living in 
                    harmony with the universe. You'll likely come across many
                    ideas about what yoga is and what it is not, but the general 
                    idea is that yoga is a holistic method for strengthening
                    not only your body, but your mind and spirit as well.

                    Classes are mixed ability, meaning that experienced 
                    students are in the same class as beginners. The regulars 
                    are used
                    to new people joining in and help to create an open, 
                    welcoming environment for practice. Everyone is encouraged 
                    to work within their own ability and to listen to their 
                    bodies.
                    Being part of a class is important as you can learn from 
                    other's questions and from seeing the their work. Sometimes
                    classes are quiet and meditative; sometimes classes are 
                    full of laughter and delight.
                    A particular series of poses can affect your mood in very 
                    different but positive ways. In classes there is a good
                    balance between sharing the yoga experience with others and 
                    respecting each other's space for calm and reflection.
