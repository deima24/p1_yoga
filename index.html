                    <p>
                        Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and 
                        improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American
                        College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment 
                        for chronic low back pain.

                        Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide 
                        inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. Several
                        of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high 
                        blood 
                        pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed
                        through yoga.

                        you get in the right mindset and prepare your body to
                        fall asleep and stay asleep.

                        According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific 
                        evidence shows that yoga supports stress management, mental
                        health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality 
                        sleep.

                        an environment for group healing and support.
